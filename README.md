## II. Detailed Dashboard Walkthrough and Insights
## 1. Department-Wise Attrition
Visual: Pie Chart – Department Breakdown
•	Research & Development: Highest attrition (56.12%), indicating critical instability in a key business function.
•	Sales: Second highest (38.8%), a common high-turnover area, but warrants deep attention.
•	Human Resources: Lowest attrition (5.06%), showing stronger internal retention.
✅ Interpretation:
Departments closest to product/service delivery (R&D and Sales) are most vulnerable, risking core operational effectiveness if not addressed.

## 2. Employee Count by Age Group and Gender
Visual: Stacked Bar Chart – Age and Gender Segmentation
•	Age 26-35: Largest employee group, critical for mid-level operational strength.
•	Gender Split: Mild male dominance across age bands; balance considerations for DEI strategies.
✅ Interpretation:
The company’s workforce is young to mid-career, offering agility but also a higher attrition risk if career progression isn't actively managed.

## 3. Attrition Rate by Gender for Different Age Groups
Visual: Donut Charts – Gender-wise Attrition Rate
•	Under 25 and 26-35: Highest absolute attrition numbers.
•	Male attrition is marginally higher across age groups.
✅ Interpretation:
Younger employees (especially <35) require robust career planning, mentorship, and engagement initiatives to curb attrition early.

## 4. Attrition by Salary Slab
Visual: Horizontal Bar Chart – Salary Range Attrition
•	<5K Salary Bracket: 163 attritions — overwhelmingly dominant.
•	Attrition sharply declines as salary increases.
✅ Interpretation:
Salary competitiveness is a serious retention lever, particularly at entry-level or junior roles.

## 5. Attrition by Job Role
Visual: Bar Chart – Specific Roles Impacted
•	Top 3 High-Attrition Roles:
o	Laboratory Technician
o	Sales Executive
o	Research Scientist
✅ Interpretation:
Specialized roles are at risk. Losing technical and client-facing talent can result in knowledge drain and revenue loss.

## 6. Education Field-wise Attrition
Visual: Horizontal Bar Chart – Education Background Impact
•	Employees from Life Sciences and Medical educational backgrounds dominate attrition.
•	Marketing and Technical Degrees follow at a distance.
✅ Interpretation:
Sector-specific career mobility trends might be causing higher exits; alignment of role expectations and growth opportunities is necessary.

## 7. Attrition by Years at Company
Visual: Line Chart – Tenure-wise Attrition Trend
•	First 2 Years: Peak attrition (especially Year 1 and Year 2).
•	Post 5 Years: Significant stabilization.
✅ Interpretation:
Retention efforts must be front-loaded within the first two years of employment to build long-term loyalty.

## 8. Job Satisfaction Rating Analysis
Visual: Heatmap – Job Role vs Satisfaction Scores
•	Low satisfaction observed among Sales Executives and Sales Representatives.
•	Research Scientists and Managers show higher satisfaction spread.
✅ Interpretation:
Job satisfaction directly correlates with attrition risk. Targeted engagement for Sales and client-facing employees is critical.
